# Assignment-2--Reinforcement-Learning-Programming---CSCN-8020

This project implements and analyzes Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms using the OpenAI Gymnasium environment. The focus is on training and evaluating an agent to perform tasks under different learning and exploration parameters.

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of reinforcement learning methods using the OpenAI Gymnasium Taxi-v3 environment. The main objective is to train an autonomous agent capable of efficiently navigating and completing pickup–dropoff tasks while optimizing long-term rewards.

The notebook implements the Q-Learning algorithm and compares the performance of various hyperparameter combinations—specifically learning rate (α) and exploration factor (ε)—to understand their impact on convergence speed, stability, and overall learning efficiency.

Through systematic experimentation and visualization of average rewards, steps per episode, and training progress, the project highlights the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.
It concludes by identifying the best-performing parameter set (α = 0.2, ε = 0.1) that achieves higher average rewards, faster convergence, and improved policy robustness.
